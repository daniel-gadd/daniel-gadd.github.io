#### Hello! ####

Hi, I'm Daniel, im from Wellington NZ, I work as a Information Security consultant (a.k.a ethical hacker)
and also work as a system IT administrator for a small NZ business.

I Live in windy Wellington, have a small young family with two Daughters, Aria and Amy-Rose and a loving wife, Jenna.
In my spare time I like being outdoors, walking, spending time with family and trying new things.

##### What Can I Do? #####


I have been in the IT industry for a long time, I was tinkering with computers from a young age. I have been in the
Infomation Security Industry for 4 years specialising in Network infrastructure security and secure network
design and implimentation.

I also look after a comfortable amount of globally located servers, network equiptment and users for my current employer,
where I have learnt alot of techniques and skills on the job.

**What am I skilled in?**
<ul>
  <li>Linux OS (specically, Debian/Ubuntu)</li>
  <li>Windows OS (unfortunately)</li>
  <li>Mac OS</li>
  <li>Puppet</li>
  <li>Bash</li>
  <li>KVM Virtualisation</li>
  <li>SSH</li>

  <li>Juniper EX Series Switches</li>
  <li>IPSEC VPN</li>
  <li>DevOps Technologies</li>
  <li>nginx/apache</li>
  <li>Various network and web application penetration testing techniques</li>
</ul>

#### Why the site? ####

Good question, I decided it was time to actually have a website. I chose [octopress](http://octopress.org/) as a good framework.


**Why Octopress?**

Well, for starters my development ability is fairly limited, I've never written a website (HTML) or used a framework properly before.
I wanted something that integrated lots of platform technologies I get exposed to everyday, but also remain lightweight **AND STATIC
 - I WORK IN THE INFOSEC INDUSTRY**


 Therefore octopress was a good start, ruby, github, markdown and static content served.


 **Thats all interesting, but whats the site for?**

 Ultimately I want to share interesting finds and code snippets, but also serve as a place I can quickly lookup stuff I *Dont want to forget*.



**I can haz you sauce-code?**
