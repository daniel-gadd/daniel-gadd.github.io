## About

Hello! I'm Daniel Gadd from Wellington New Zealand. I am an Infrastructure and DevOps skilled person who loves doing what I do. I have skills in Networking concepts, Linux administration, Juniper and cisco networking, virtualisation with KVM, cloud IAAS, Configuration management with puppet, devOps tools like git, jenkins, and CD/CI workflows

This is a small blog site built on jekyll with mostly reminders of how I did things, or why I did, hopefully you will find something helpful.
